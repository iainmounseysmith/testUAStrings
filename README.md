# testUAStrings
Inspired by the Evil Tester.The idea here is to be able to test url re-direction for a given url using a list of user agent strings
sourced from http://useragentstring.com/.
May never use this, but a useful learning experience none the less.
Presently only runs FireFox but will add headless driver support too.
